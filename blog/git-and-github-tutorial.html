<h1>A (Non)comprehensive Git and GitHub Tutorial</h1>
<h2>Mike Vo, December 5th, 2020</h2>
<hr>

<p>
    Version control is an important concept in software development. Collaboration of many contributors to one project
    requires great coordination. Sometimes, experimental changes to the project may be needed, and if two or more people
    made conflicting changes, it is very time consuming to resolve the issue, especially if the collaborators are
    working over long distances or if direct communication is impractical. Version control is a piece of software that
    aids with resolving those issues and helps increasing the speed and efficiency of development by keeping track of
    file changes and archiving older versions of a project.
</p>
<p>
    Git is a free and open source version control software (among others like SVN, Mecurial, Monotone and many more…)
    aimed to expedite IT projects of both simple and complex architecture<a
        href="#git-and-github-tutorial-ref-1">[1]</a>. GitHub is an online repository (project) hosting website designed
    to work with Git. As of 2016, Git and GitHub are two of the most popular tools among professionals working with
    software development<a href="#git-and-github-tutorial-ref-2">[2]</a>.
</p>
<p>
    In the next 9 steps, we will learn how to install Git, set up a GitHub account and start using them for our projects.
    You should be familiar with navigating between different folders using your operating system command shell. Tutorial
    on how to use the command line can be found here:

<h3 id="step-1-registering-a-github-account-to-host-your-project-online">Step 1: Registering a GitHub account to host
    your project online:</h3>
<ul>
    <li><p>Register your account at <a href="https://github.com/join">https://github.com/join</a>.</p></li>
    <li><p>If you have never used GitHub before, it is recommended that you check out the Hello World guide provided by
        GitHub (<a href="https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world">https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world</a>)
        to understand the basic concepts of repository and workflow.</p></li>
    <li><p>GitHub is a paid service for large and complex projects. However, if you are a university student or teacher,
        you might be eligible for a discount on GitHub’s services. In that case, you can use the email provided by your
        school to sign up for a discount at <a href="https://education.github.com">https://education.github.com</a>. For
        further information, please contact your organization.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="step-2-installing-and-setting-up-git">Step 2: Installing and setting up Git</h3>
<ul>
    <li><p>Git can be installed following the instructions on <a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads">https://git-scm.com/downloads</a>
    </p></li>
    <li><p>The first thing to do after Git is installed on your local machine is configuring Git with your GitHub
        username and email address. Open your terminal and type the following commands (Git commands are the same across
        operating systems):</p></li>
</ul>
<div class="code-block">
    <pre><code>
        $ git config --global user.name "<em>your-github-username</em>"&nbsp;
        $ git config --global email "<em>your-email@domain.com</em>
    </code></pre>
</div>
<ul>
    <li><p>Done! It is that simple. Now we will learn how to use Git and GitHub to version control your project.</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="step-3-create-a-new-project-via-github">Step 3: Create a new project via GitHub</h3>
<ul>
    <li><p>Login to your GitHub account. Assuming you have already followed the “Hello World” tutorial provided by
        GitHub, you should be able to create a new repository for your project. After it is created, it should look like
        this on your browser:</p></li>
</ul>
<p><img src="../media/12.2020/image23.png" alt="screenshot" style="width:5.73958in;height:2.74274in" class="img-fluid"/></p>
<ul>
    <li><p>Click the green “Code” button and copy the HTTPS link from the drop-down menu.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><img src="../media/12.2020/image24.png" alt="screenshot" style="width:3.78807in;height:3.10937in" class="img-fluid"/></p>
<ul>
    <li><p><strong>If you already have an existing project on your local machine skip to <em>“Step 4: Configure your
        existing project to work with Git”</em>.</strong></p></li>
    <li><p>Navigate to a folder on your local machine where you would like to put your project and type the following
        command:</p></li>
</ul>
<div class="code-block">
    <pre><code>
        $ git clone <em>paste the copied https link here</em>
    </code></pre>
</div>
<ul>
    <li><p>You will be asked to login to your GitHub account either via a graphical window or the command prompt:</p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><img src="../media/12.2020/image25.png" alt="screenshot" style="width:3.11553in;height:3.16146in" class="img-fluid"/></p>
<p>Or</p>
<div class="code-block">
    <pre><code>
        Username for 'https://github.com': <em>yourusername</em>&nbsp;
        Password for 'https://yourusername@github.com': <em>yourpassword</em>
    </code></pre>
</div>
<ul>
    <li><p>If you entered everything correctly, you would now have your project folder downloaded onto your machine and
        the command line output should be similar to this:</p></li>
</ul>
<div class="code-block">
    <pre><code>
        remote: Enumerating objects: 3, done.&nbsp;
        remote: Counting objects: 100% (3/3), done.&nbsp;
        remote: Total 3 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0&nbsp;
        Unpacking objects: 100% (3/3), done.
    </code></pre>
</div>

<h3 id="step-4-configure-your-existing-project-to-work-with-git">Step 4: Configure your existing project to work with
    Git</h3>
<ul>
    <li><p><strong>Ignore this step if you have already completed <em>“Step 3: Create a new project via
        GitHub”</em>.</strong></p></li>
    <li><p>Navigate to your project folder using the command line.</p></li>
    <li><p>Initialize the folder to work with Git with this command:</p></li>
</ul>
<div class="code-block">
    <pre><code>
        $ git init
    </code></pre>
</div>
<ul>
    <li><p>Add the files and changes you want Git to keep track of:</p></li>
</ul>
<div class="code-block">
    <pre><code>
        $ git add .&nbsp;
        # Add all the files and folders in the current folder.&nbsp;
        # Alternatively, you can use git add <em>filename</em> for individual&nbsp;
        # files.
    </code></pre>
</div>
<ul>
    <li><p>Commit the added content to Git’s library to be prepared for uploading, note that the comment in the double
        quote is required:</p></li>
</ul>
<div class="code-block">
    <pre><code>
        $ git commit -m “Initial commit”
    </code></pre>
</div>
<ul>
    <li><p>Setup Git to work with GitHub for the current project:</p></li>
</ul>
<div class="code-block">
    <pre><code>
        $ git remote add origin <em>paste the https link in step 3 here</em>&nbsp;
        # Sets the new remote&nbsp;
        $ git remote -v&nbsp;
        # Verifies the new remote URL
    </code></pre>
</div>
<ul>
    <li><p>“Push” your files to GitHub to finish:</p></li>
</ul>
<div class="code-block">
    <pre><code>
        $ git push origin main
    </code></pre>
</div>

<h3 id="step-5-your-editor-of-choice">Step 5: Your editor of choice</h3>
<p>
    For software development projects, there are many text editors that support Git version control. The most popular
    ones are <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a>, <a href="https://atom.io/">Atom</a>, and
    <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a>. If you are working with a modern integrated development
    environment (IDE), it will most probably also have Git support. Consult the relevant software documentation for more
    information on version control support. After installing and configuring your editor, you should be able to start
    writing your code and building your project. Next comes the exciting part!</p>

<h3 id="step-6-add-commit-and-push">Step 6: Add, commit and push</h3>
<p>To start contributing to the project we are hosting on GitHub, the <em>add</em>, <em>commit</em>, and <em>push</em>
    commands are our powerful allies. After you have finished with your edits on the local file, it is time to upload it
    onto the project GitHub repository.</p>
<div class="code-block">
    <pre><code>
        $ git add .&nbsp;
        $ git commit -m “<em>description of your changes</em>”&nbsp;
        $ git push
    </code></pre>
</div>
<p>For individual files, you can use this command instead:</p>
<div class="code-block">
    <pre><code>
        $ git add <em>filename</em>
    </code></pre>
</div>

<h3 id="step-7-pull-and-how-it-can-help-you-resolve-conflict">Step 7: Pull and how it can help you resolve conflict</h3>
<p>Conflict happens when multiple people are working on one file and their local changes does not match that of the
    online repository. In this case, attempts to push your changes to the repository will result in an error
    message:</p>
<div class="code-block">
    <pre><code>
        To https://github.com/yourusername/repo.git&nbsp;
         ! [rejected]        main -> main (fetch first)&nbsp;
        error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/yourusername/repo.git'&nbsp;
        hint: Updates were rejected because the remote contains work that you do&nbsp;
        hint: not have locally. This is usually caused by another repository pushing&nbsp;
        hint: to the same ref. You may want to first integrate the remote changes&nbsp;
        hint: (e.g., 'git pull ...') before pushing again.&nbsp;
        hint: See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details.&nbsp;
    </code></pre>
</div>
<p>Use the pull command to download the conflicting changes from the repository.</p>
<div class="code-block">
    <pre><code>
        $ git pull<br>
        Username for 'https://github.com': yourusername&nbsp;
        Password for 'https://miketvo@github.com':&nbsp;
        remote: Enumerating objects: 5, done.&nbsp;
        remote: Counting objects: 100% (5/5), done.&nbsp;
        remote: Total 3 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0&nbsp;
        Unpacking objects: 100% (3/3), done.&nbsp;
        From https://github.com/yourusername/repo&nbsp;
           7b32407..050181c  main       -> origin/main&nbsp;
        Auto-merging README.md&nbsp;
        CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in README.md&nbsp;
        Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.
    </code></pre>
</div>
<p>
    Your Git-compatible editor should show you your changes versus the conflicting changes, and you can discuss with your
    colleagues on which change to keep. After you have edited the file to have the desired changes, you can now use the
    commands in <em>Step 6</em> to upload the changes and resolve the conflict.</p>
<p>It is recommended that we use <em>git pull</em> at the start of each work session to avoid potential conflicts.</p>
<h3 id="step-8-branching">Step 8: Branching</h3>
<p>
    When working on a new feature of a project, it is a good idea to modify a copy of the project itself before “merging”
    the copy into the main project files. This is called “branching” and is an essential process of software
    development.</p>
<p>Navigate to our git-ready project folder using the command line and type the following command:</p>
<div class="code-block">
    <pre><code>
        $ git branch<br>
        <strong>* main</strong>   # The currently active branch&nbsp;
        branch1&nbsp;
        branch2
    </code></pre>
</div>
<p>The branch command can also create new branches:</p>
<div class="code-block">
    <pre><code>
        $ git branch <em>new-branch</em> # This command has no output
    </code></pre>
</div>
<p>To switch between branches, we “check them out”:</p>
<div class="code-block">
    <pre><code>
        $ git checkout <em>new-branch</em><br>
        Switched to branch 'new-branch'
    </code></pre>
</div>
<p>
    When we are done with implementing new files into our branch, it is time “push” it to GitHub. If the branch already
    exists on GitHub and we are just adding to it, simply follow <em>Step 6</em>. On the other hand, if it only exists
    on our local machine and not on GitHub, we will have to use these commands instead:</p>
<div class="code-block">
    <pre><code>
        $ git add .&nbsp;
        $ git commit -m “add a new branch”&nbsp;
        $ git push origin <em>new-branch</em>
    </code></pre>
</div>
<p>
    This will create a new branch in the online GitHub repository and pushes the content of our new branch into it. After
    development of a new feature is complete, we can go to our GitHub repository with a web browser to create a pull
    request to merge the new feature into the main branch. More information on branching and merging can be found in the
    GitHub’s <em>Hello World</em> tutorial or here: <a

    This tutorial is intended as a crash course to get you started with using Git and GitHub. More advanced tutorials
    such as <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/search/?query=git">these ones on freeCodeCamp</a> can also help
    us delve deeper into software development workflow using version control. Git is a very powerful and versatile tool,
    so to utilize all of its feature, please refer to the Git and GitHub documentation for more comprehensive
    information. In the IT world, it is unavoidable that we will have to read a lot of documentation as new technologies
    emerge and replace the obsolete. This is one of the most important skills for an IT professional.</p>
